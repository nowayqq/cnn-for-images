# cnn-for-images
The model was trained on cifar10 dataset http://www.cs.toronto.edu/~kriz/cifar.html

To run and test the model, I prepared 2 scripts example1.py and example2.py

To run example1.py you need to download 'images' folder and example1.py and run this in cmd by 'python example1.py'

To run example2.py you need to download example2.py, create 'your_images' folder 
put images there and name them 'img0', 'img1', 'img2', etc, run this in cmd by 'python example2.py'

Note: The .jpg is only acceptable format for images
